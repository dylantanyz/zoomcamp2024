## Question 1-2
Just run the docker commands as required (Answers are `--rm` and `0.42.0`)

## Question 3
Ingested the data using Notebook - refer to "Homework 1.ipynb" in Notebooks folder. Then run the following SQL:

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.green_taxi_data
WHERE 
CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-18' AND
CAST(lpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-18';
```
Result was `15612`.

## Question 4
Used the following:
```
SELECT CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) as day,
MAX(trip_distance)
FROM public.green_taxi_data
WHERE 
CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-18' OR
CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-16' OR
CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-26' OR
CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-21'
GROUP BY day;
```
`2019-09-26` has the largest distance at 341.64.

## Question 5
Used the following:

```
SELECT 
 SUM(t.total_amount),
 CONCAT(zpu."Borough") AS "pickup_loc"
FROM
	public.green_taxi_data t
	JOIN public.zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
    JOIN public.zones zdo ON t."PULocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
WHERE
    CAST(t.lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) = '2019-09-18'
GROUP BY zpu."Borough"
HAVING SUM(t.total_amount) > 50000
ORDER BY pickup_loc ASC;
```

The resulting set has only `Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn`.

## Question 6
Used the following:

```
SELECT 
 MAX(t.tip_amount),
 zpu."Zone" AS "pickup_loc",
 zdo."Zone" AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
	public.green_taxi_data t
	JOIN public.zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
	JOIN public.zones zdo ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
WHERE
 zpu."Zone" = 'Astoria'
GROUP BY zpu."Zone", zdo."Zone"
ORDER by max DESC;
```

`JFK Airport` had the largest tip at 62.31 (followed by Woodside at 30).

## Question 7
