# Setup
## Getting fhv taxi parquet files into GCS
Similar to Homework 3, downloaded the files into GCP VM and uploaded to GCS. Then used BigQuery to natively ingest table from GCS, reading the schema automatically.

# Homework
## Question 1: What happens when we execute dbt build --vars '{'is_test_run':'true'}'
It applies a limit 100 only to our staging models - as the core code blocks do not have the devlimit statement at the end.

## Question 2: What is the code that our CI job will run? Where is this code coming from?
The code from the development branch we are requesting to merge to main

## Question 3: What is the count of records in the model fact_fhv_trips after running all dependencies with the test run variable disabled (:false)?
Closest is 42,998,722. (Actual was 43,244,696)

## Question 4: What is the service that had the most rides during the month of July 2019 month with the biggest amount of rides after building a tile for the fact_fhv_trips table?
Yellow with `3,239,083`, then Green with `415,377`, then FHV with `290,667`.
