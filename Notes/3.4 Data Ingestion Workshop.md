## Setup
Downloaded to github codespace account, ran jupyter notebook on homework_starter.ipynb

## Question 1: What is the sum of the outputs of the generator for limit = 5?
Added a "sum" variable and incremented it by the output of the generator in the for loop:

```
def square_root_generator(limit):
    n = 1
    while n <= limit:
        yield n ** 0.5
        n += 1

# Example usage:
limit = 5
generator = square_root_generator(limit)

sum = 0

for sqrt_value in generator:
    print(f'Returned {sqrt_value}')
    sum += sqrt_value

print(sum)
```

The printed sum is `8.382332347441762`.

## Question 2: What is the 13th number yielded
Changed the limit to 13 and took the value: `3.605551275463989`

## Question 3: Append the 2 generators. After correctly appending the data, calculate the sum of all ages of people.
First, import dlt. Then create a pipeline with a duckdb destination. Summing all the ages, we get `353`.

```
import dlt

sum = 0
def people_1():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        yield {"ID": i, "Name": f"Person_{i}", "Age": 25 + i, "City": "City_A"}

for person in people_1():
    print(person)
    sum += person["Age"]

print(sum)

def people_2():
    for i in range(3, 9):
        yield {"ID": i, "Name": f"Person_{i}", "Age": 30 + i, "City": "City_B", "Occupation": f"Job_{i}"}

for person in people_2():
    print(person)
    sum += person["Age"]

print(sum)

# define the connection to load to.
# We now use duckdb, but you can switch to Bigquery later
generators_pipeline = dlt.pipeline(destination='duckdb', dataset_name='generators')


# we can load any generator to a table at the pipeline destnation as follows:
info = generators_pipeline.run(people_1(),
										table_name="people_table",
										write_disposition="append")

info = generators_pipeline.run(people_2(),
										table_name="people_table",
										write_disposition="append")

# the outcome metadata is returned by the load and we can inspect it by printing it.
print(info)
```

To sum within duckdb using SQL, we can use the following python code:
```
# show outcome

import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect(f"{generators_pipeline.pipeline_name}.duckdb")

# let's see the tables
conn.sql(f"SET search_path = '{generators_pipeline.dataset_name}'")
print('Loaded tables: ')
display(conn.sql("show tables"))

# and the data

print("\n\n\n people_table below:")

table = conn.sql("SELECT * FROM people_table").df()
display(table)

sum_sql = conn.sql("SELECT SUM(AGE) FROM people_table").df()
display(sum_sql)
```

## Question 4: Merge the 2 generators using the ID column. Calculate the sum of ages of all the people loaded as described above.
Created a new duckdb table (`merge_people_table`), then modified the `write_disposition` to append and specified `ID` as the `primary_key`. Result for the new sum is `266`.

```
conn = duckdb.connect(f"{generators_pipeline.pipeline_name}.duckdb")
drop_table = conn.sql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS merge_people_table;")
display(drop_table)

generators_pipeline = dlt.pipeline(destination='duckdb', dataset_name='generators')

info = generators_pipeline.run(people_1(),
										table_name="merge_people_table",
										write_disposition="merge",
                                        primary_key="ID")

info = generators_pipeline.run(people_2(),
										table_name="merge_people_table",
										write_disposition="merge",
                                        primary_key="ID")

print(info)


conn.sql(f"SET search_path = '{generators_pipeline.dataset_name}'")
print('Loaded tables: ')
display(conn.sql("show tables"))

print("\n\n\n merge_people_table below:")

table = conn.sql("SELECT * FROM merge_people_table").df()
display(table)

sum_sql = conn.sql("SELECT SUM(AGE) FROM merge_people_table").df()
display(sum_sql)
```
